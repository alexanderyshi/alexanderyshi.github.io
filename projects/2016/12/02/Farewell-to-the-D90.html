Although this definitely is true, there does come a time when you find yourself looking for a few more bells and whistles with your setup. I picked up my Nikon D90 again last summer looking for a hobby to keep me occupied again on my coop term. I got into the groove of taking pictures of my friends and occasionally people on the street, and really enjoyed it. The photos were looking not too shabby too, but I started to realize there were definitely limitations I was hitting with this hardware. In low light conditions and indoors, I found myself unable to capture photos without blur becoming a big problem. Switching to a 50 FX prime from my 18-200 zoom made for a good improvement with speed. I switched to shooting RAW to be able to squeeze out detail in post production. These made for huge gains - I could shoot clear shots in low light now, but they were mostly underexposed. ISO was the last thing I wanted to touch. I knew that picture quality was greatly diminished by ISO 800, and suffered heavily by the time I hit 1600+. A good bit of time went into going into Lightroom and mitigate the graininess. As a student with no plans to turn my hobby into a workflow, I could have been content. My dad acquired the D90 in the summer of 2009 on a family trip to the Rockies. Since then, the D7000, D7100, and most recent D7200 have come out, culminating in a much improved sensor for low-light conditions. The resolution increased to 6k by 4k pixels, which allowed for plenty of cropping room too. People have even made performance comparisons between the D7200 and entry level FX D610. I started poking through classifieds and looking for sales to see if I could find a D610 or a D7200 cheap, but alas, the weak CAD was not helping at all. Then came a Black Friday sale and my dad making a miraculous offer to help me get one. I’ve been trying to be mostly autonomous with my expenses at university, but at this point I guess I didn’t mind the gift that could last for many a year. The old D90 body is being sent back to China for my cousin to use as a backup camera at his photography shop." /><meta property="og:description" content="It is often said that the greatest camera is the one with you.
